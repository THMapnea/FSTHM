# THMfocusStacking
This project mission is to create a library that can be used via API trough library compilation to perform focus stacking operation without depending on library written in a language who doesn't support OpenCV, if you want to use a more advanced version or you need to perform some focus stacking you can head on my website to try it, at the time of writing the website is still in-building so it might not be available for now. To build this algorithm I used the most common approaches to focust stacking by implementing, laplacian, DFT and some wavelet's to see if there exist a way to obtain a sharp and precise focus stacking, this project has been made with the intent to provide an "easy" way to have a focus stack of a photo without needing to pay for a specific software since I am the only one managing it, it would be nice if the use of it can be done trough the website instead of locally so that I can get back something hoping that it will be useful to somebody. I will try to mantain and update the code as much as possible every hint or help is always appreciated
